# PCC-RPG
A 2D video game collaborated on by two students at Pasadena City College for their final for their Intro to Object-Oriented Programming class in Fall 2020. Uses C++, SFML, and CMake to run. The player progresses and travels across a 3x3 map to eventually reach the middle of the map to beat the final boss and thus win.

The work shown here is the final result as when submitted and as such could be greatly improved upon. Additionally part of the code as well was given by the professor of the class used to run the game, as seen in the main.cpp and the GameFiles folder.
